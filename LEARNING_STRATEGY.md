# Midnight Wallet - Simple Learning Approach

**Philosophy:** Learn by doing. Expand when needed.

---

## Simple Rules

### 1. Before Implementing
- **Ask me questions** if anything is unclear
- **I'll explain WHY** something exists (not just HOW)
- **We move forward** when you're ready

### 2. During Implementation
- **I reference relevant guidelines** before writing code
- **You challenge** anything that seems off
- **We iterate** until it's right

### 3. If Stuck
- **Say "I'm confused about X"** - we'll take a step back
- **Request diagrams** if visual helps
- **Ask for React analogy** if it helps map to what you know

## Optional Deep-Dives

**Available if you need them:**

### Visual Learning
- Request architecture diagrams
- Request flow charts
- Request sequence diagrams

### React Comparisons
- "How is this like useState?"
- "How is this like useEffect?"
- "What's the Kotlin equivalent of X?"

### Proof of Concept
- Write throwaway code to experiment
- Test assumptions in isolation
- Then write real implementation

## Weekly Check-In (Optional)

Quick reflection:
- What clicked this week?
- What's still fuzzy?
- Anything to adjust?

## That's It!

Keep it simple. Expand when needed. You drive the pace.
